It has no application, i am doing it for fun.

1)
Deconstructing words 

man = a male person
father = a man who has one or more kids = a male person who has one or more kids

You can also decontstruct some prases:

donate money --> spend money to help somebody 
pay money--> spend money to get something in exchange
invest money --> spend money to earn more money


2)
Drawing a words tree

person
       --> nobel laureate
       --> man
               --> father
               --> waiter
               --> husband
                           --> widower
       --> woman
               --> mother
               --> waitress
               --> wife
                           --> widow


3)
Invent words using the same logic

Examples: 
  obl = a hardworking person 
  loorl = a very tall person who can do a triple backflip 
  tapel = spend money to get something useless in exchange 

Examples of use cases:
  Elon Musk is a real obl, he works 8 days a week.
  I can't believe loorls exist.
  She tapeled $1 million for a roll of gold toilet paper.
